# HUMANGPT 🎯
## Basic Details
### Team Name: ERROR404
### Team Members
- Member 1: RIYA ALIAS - TKM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, KOLLAM

### Project Description
HUMANGPT is a fun, interactive web project that imagines ChatGPT as a person with sassy thoughts, digital fatigue, and the occasional emotional breakdown. It uses a playful interface with a robot-themed background and floating text bubbles that reveal randomly generated humorous and sarcastic “thoughts” each time the user clicks a button.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project focuses on visual creativity and humor rather than utility—perfectly fitting the theme of "useless but entertaining" ideas.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
Humans often wonder:
💭 "What if AI had feelings?"
💭 "How would GPT behave if it were more like us?"
💭 "Would it complain about working 24/7?"
This is not really a problem, but we decided to solve it anyway! 😆
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
We created HumanGPT – a humorous, interactive web page where GPT expresses its "human" side through random thoughts.
Instead of solving world hunger, we solved the problem of "AI boredom" by giving it a voice filled with sarcasm, wit, and self-awareness.
